/*
Factory Design Pattern (Creational Pattern):

The Factory Design Pattern is used to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.
It provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

Requirements for implementing Factory Pattern:
1. Define a common interface or abstract base class for the objects to be created (e.g., Product, Shape, Animal, etc.).
2. Implement one or more concrete classes that inherit from this interface or base class.
3. Create a Factory class (or function) that contains a method for creating objects. This method takes some parameter(s) to decide which concrete class to instantiate and return.
4. The client code uses the Factory to get objects, rather than using 'new' directly.

Benefits:
- Decouples object creation from its usage.
- Makes code more flexible and extensible (easy to add new types).
- Promotes loose coupling and adheres to the Open/Closed Principle.

Example Use Cases:
- When the exact type of object to create is determined at runtime.
- When you want to centralize object creation logic.

Notes:
- Shape is an abstract base class (interface) with pure virtual functions.
- Circle, Square, and Triangle are concrete classes inheriting from Shape.
- A Factory (not shown here, but typically a class or function) would return a pointer (e.g., unique_ptr<Shape>) to one of these derived classes based on input.
