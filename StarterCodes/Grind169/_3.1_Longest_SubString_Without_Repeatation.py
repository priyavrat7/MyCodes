# Time Complexity = O(n)
# At first glance it looks like it could be O(nÂ²) if while runs many times.
# But hereâ€™s the key insight:

# ðŸ”· Each character is added to myset once, and removed from myset once.
# 	â€¢	Each add and remove operation is O(1) (because set in Python is a hash set).
# 	â€¢	Therefore the total number of add/remove operations over the whole string is at most 2n.

# â¸»

# ðŸ”· âš¡ Why O(n)?

# âœ… Even though the inner while seems nested, it only runs once per unique character, and each character is processed at most twice (once added, once removed).
